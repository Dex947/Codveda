## Task 1: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
 *Description:* Implement a logistic regression model to
    predict binary outcomes (e.g., whether a customer
    will churn).
 *Objectives:* 
    Load and preprocess the dataset.
    Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
    Interpret model coefficients and the odds ratio.
    Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy,
    precision, recall, and the ROC curve.
 *Tools:* Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
