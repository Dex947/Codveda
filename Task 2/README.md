## Task 2: Decision Trees for Classification
 *Description:* Build a decision tree classifier to predict
    a categorical outcome (e.g., predict species of
    flowers).
 *Objectives:*
    Train a decision tree on a labeled dataset (e.g., the Iris
    dataset).
    Visualize the tree structure.
    Prune the tree to prevent overfitting.
    Evaluate the model using classification metrics such as
    accuracy and F1-score.
 *Tools:* Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
